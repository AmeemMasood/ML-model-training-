Delivery Time Prediction using Random Forest

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict delivery time using the Random Forest algorithm. It includes model training, evaluation, and visualization of important features and predictions.

Project Overview

Accurate delivery time prediction helps improve logistics efficiency and customer satisfaction. In this project, a Random Forest regression model is trained on historical delivery data to estimate delivery times based on multiple input features.

The project also includes visual analysis to better understand feature importance and prediction behavior.

Features:
1.Training a Random Forest regression model

2.Predicting delivery time

3.Feature importance visualization

4.Histogram of predicted delivery times

5.Model evaluation using MAE only

6.Clean and reproducible ML pipeline


Model Training:

The Random Forest model is trained using historical delivery data and relevant features.

Key steps:

1.Data loading and cleaning

2.Feature selection and preprocessing

3.Train-test split

4.Random Forest training

5.Model validatio
